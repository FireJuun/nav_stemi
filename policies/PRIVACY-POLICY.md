Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect information about you in the following ways:

* **Information You Provide to Us:**  We do not directly collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, address, email address, etc. through the App. The App is designed to store patient data securely within the app using the FHIR standard. This data is under the control of the healthcare provider and is not accessed or stored by us.

* **Location Data:** We collect your device's location data to provide navigation functionality within the App. This data is used solely for mapping purposes and is not linked to any PII. You can enable or disable location services in your device settings.

* **Camera Data:** The App uses your device's camera to scan barcodes on driver's licenses. This is used to help pre-populate patient demographic information within the FHIR record and streamline data entry for EMS professionals. No images or data from the driver's license are stored by the App.

* **Device Information:** We collect information about your device, such as the device model, operating system, unique device identifiers, and crash reports. This information is used to improve the App's performance and troubleshoot technical issues.

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

**3. Disclosure of Your Information**

We do not share your information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your information:

* **As Required by Law:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.

**4. Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the email address below.

**6. Open Source Nature of the App**

The App is open-source software. The source code is publicly available, and users are free to modify and distribute the App.  This means that others may be able to view and modify the App's code, including any privacy features. We encourage users to review the code and understand how it handles data before using the App.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
