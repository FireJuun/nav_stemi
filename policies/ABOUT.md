## navSTEMI Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy was generated with the assistance of Gemini Advanced, a large language model from Google AI, on December 3, 2024. It is intended to serve as a starting point for the navSTEMI app's privacy policy and should be customized to fit the specific details of the app and its data handling practices.

**Current Status:**

This privacy policy is currently **for testing purposes only**.  No actual patient demographics or data will be stored in the app during this phase of development.

**Intended Use:**

This privacy policy is intended to be used in the following ways:

* **GitHub:**  It will be included in the navSTEMI repository on GitHub to provide developers and contributors with an understanding of the app's intended approach to data privacy.
* **Future App Stores:** Once the app is ready for release on Google Play and Apple App Stores, this document will be adapted and used as the basis for the publicly displayed privacy policy.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Customization:** This is a template and **must be customized** before being used in a production environment. Be sure to replace the bracketed information with your own and tailor the language to accurately reflect the app's functionality.
* **Legal Review:** It is highly recommended that you have this privacy policy reviewed by an attorney to ensure it complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, before releasing the app to the public.
* **Open Source:**  The open-source nature of the app means that others may be able to view and modify the app's code, including any privacy features.  This should be clearly communicated to users.

**Gemini Advanced:**

Gemini Advanced is an AI model with a large context window and access to up-to-date information. It was used to generate this initial draft of the privacy policy based on the specific requirements of the navSTEMI app, including its use of FHIR for data storage, location data for navigation, and the camera for barcode scanning.

This ABOUT.md file aims to provide transparency about the origin and intended use of this privacy policy. It is crucial to remember that this is a work in progress and requires further refinement before being used in a live environment.
